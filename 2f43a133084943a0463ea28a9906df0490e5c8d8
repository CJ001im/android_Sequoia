My phone is set in timezone UTC+2, and when setting target time of 06:00am in the lineagepart UI, the notification message is 2 hours off (\u0027charging will be complete at 08:00\u0027) and so seems the actual time that charging approx. stops: it stops around 08:00 local time. Can\u0027t point to a specific piece of code, will have another look.",
