      "message": "I think this should continue to be the variable now.  Otherwise, stats will be slightly higher than reality (the longer the TrafficStats and getOffloadTetheringStats() calls take to complete, the less accurate the next stats calculation will be).  With respect to the traffic rate calculations I think of it this way: with now - we always count all elapsed time and we always count all bytes, with a newer last update time - we wouldn\u0027t count all elapsed time but we do count all bytes.",
