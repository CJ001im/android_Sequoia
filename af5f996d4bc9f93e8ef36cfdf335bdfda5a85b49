If the HAL brightness capability is being advertised this shouldn\u0027t be needed.\n\nAlthough the brightness capability is about /notification/ brightness control, not battery.  But it would be weird if we had HALs that changed brightness according to alpha level for notification and not battery.\n\nDo you have a HAL that only supports alpha for notification led ?",
