      "message": "It totally makes sense to me. When I leave the device charging over night and unplug after waking up I want the device to be charged to that limit as well. If we want to not do it we could make a third mode and ignore the start/target time preferences instead. We don\u0027t have to keep it at 80% when reached once. We can charge up to, let\u0027s say X-10%, let it uncharge and calculate the time when to start charging again so it reaches that limit at target time.",

      "message": "In the current implementation, if you set the limit to, like 80%, your device will charge straight up to that level and maintain that level. It will not charge to 100%. So the battery limit setting is always respected. The only thing is that the device will not wait for the target time. \n\nAnd I think the two things are identical(When the limit is set to 80%):\nApproach 1 (Current):\nCharge directly to 80% and maintain that level\nApproach 2:\nCharge to 70%, wait until target time, charge to 80%.\n\nI understand that one may want to do approach 2 when the limit is 100%. But I don\u0027t understand why you want approach 2 even if the battery level is less than 100%.",
